== Strangely this project doesn't work (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
NOTE: Update! Found the culprit it's reactor-net's dependency on netty-all:4.0.25.Final I fixed the problem, so to break it again uncomment reactor-net dependency in build.gradle and remove the exclusion.

In the last snippet curl only returns error if user
 becomes tired and shuts ratpack down. Otherwise it just hangs.
 Interesting thing is—we do receive correct response headers, just no body (hence the project name ☺):
